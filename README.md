# Multi-Language kD-tree N-body Benchmarks

This repository has small benchmark programs for N-body simulations using 
kD-trees in a variety of languages. This has grown out of an effort to test the
performance of Rust for planetary ring simulations into something of an
updated version of the n-body benchmark that is part of Benchmark Games
